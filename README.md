# punemetroDB

punemetroDB is a structured and well-organized database project built around the Pune Metro network. It provides curated data tables, preprocessing workflows, and exploratory analysis using SQL and visualization tools. The project is designed not just as a dataset, but as a foundation for building future transit-based tools—similar to the M-Indicator app used in Mumbai.

## 🚇 Project Overview

This repository includes:

- Clean, structured metro data  
  Stations, routes, distances, timings, interchange information, and more.

- Database-ready tables  
  Designed for SQL-based querying and analysis.

- Preprocessing workflows  
  Methods for cleaning, formatting, and validating transit-related data.

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  Insights, patterns, and visual summaries of Pune Metro operations.

- Tool-ready structure  
  The dataset can be extended into a full transit information tool or API for real-time metro assistance—like schedules, routes, shortest paths, and fare lookups.

## 🧩 Why This Project?

- To practice real-world, job-oriented data handling  
- To design a clean and extendable transit database  
- To understand how transit apps like M-Indicator structure their backend  
- To create a base for future app development or system integration
